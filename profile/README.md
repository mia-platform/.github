# Mia-Platform

_🚀 Don’t waste time to set up your platform, just push the code!_

## About us 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️

We are a young, talented and internationally recognized tech company with the mission to empower better software development for everyone, everywhere. Our platform is made by developers, for developers, paying attention to the positive impact of our work.


### What we do 🚀☁️  

We brought to the market the first solution for the end-to-end creation of cloud-native digital platforms. Mia-Platform, thanks to the technological excellence of its software suite, allows companies to holistically face their digital transformation journey and become Platform Companies.

Our platform is a Developer Hub to manage the end-to-end life cycle of cloud native applications and simplify the life of Dev and Ops. We also provide a marketplace full of plug-n-play components to accelerate the construction of your own digital platform.

If you want to learn more on Mia-Platform’s technology and how to use it, take a look at the [official documentation](https://docs.mia-platform.eu/) or discover our [Academy & Certification Program](https://mia-platform.eu/services/academy/).


## Open Source 💻😎

We believe in the open source community, we think it is important to give back and for this reason we have always supported the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/). Check out our open source projects.



* [micro-lc](https://github.com/micro-lc): a micro-frontend orchestrator;
* [kube-green](https://github.com/kube-green): a k8s operator that helps you reduce CO2 emissions while saving energy and money;
* [Mia-Platform Marketplace](https://github.com/mia-platform-marketplace): our marketplace central registry.

As adopters of Kubernetes, we endorse this technology through events, meetups, and content. That’s why we are among the co-organizers, together with the top players in the Italian K8s landscape, of the Kubernetes Community Days.
